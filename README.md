# Scheming

Working through ["Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours"](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) in Haskell and Rust.
Only the Haskell version is currently active.

Current state of each version:
* **Haskell**: Parses input, has REPL which allows variable assignment and user-defined functions. Some IO implemented but not yet carefully tested.
* **Rust**: Basic types, some input parsing.
