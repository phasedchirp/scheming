# Scheming

Working through ["Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours"](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) in Haskell and Rust.
The Haskell version uses Megaparsec for parsing while the Rust version is using Nom.

Current state of each version:
* **Haskell**: Some input parsing
* **Rust**: Basic data type for Lisp values (incomplete)
